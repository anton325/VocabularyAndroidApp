# Vocabulary Learning App

Learning a new language is a challenging task, and while there are many apps designed to help with this process, they often come with their own set of problems:
- They are full of ads
- Very limited free functionalities
- They don’t let you manage your own words

## Our Solution

The Vocabulary Learning App is designed to address these issues by offering a customizable and user-friendly platform that puts you in control of your language learning journey. Here's what our app offers:

- **Add and Edit Your Own Words**: Personalize your learning experience by adding and editing the vocabulary that you want to learn.
- **Organize Words in Categories**: Create categories to organize your vocabulary, making it easier to focus on specific areas of interest.
- **Record Audio for Pronunciation**: Use your microphone to record audio, allowing you to always have the correct pronunciation available. Ask a native speaker to pronounce the words for you and record it.
- **Two Ways of Learning Vocabulary**: Our app lets you study the vocabulary in both directions
- **Look Up Your Saved Words**: Easily search and review your saved vocabulary to reinforce your learning.
